<!--flexbox is a CSS layout mode that provides an efficient way to lay out 
    elements in a container so the elements behave predictably when the 
    container is resized or viewed on different screen sizes. Many 
    developers find the flexbox layout easier to use than floating elements 
    when creating fluid layouts.

        /*
        <header> and <footer> span entire width of <body>.
        <div> with id container uses "display: flex" to create a flex container.
        "flex-direction: row" places the container's flex items on the same row.
        <nav>, <main>, and <aside> all have flex-grow = 0, so all three flex items
            grow at the same rate when the browser is made wider.
        <nav>, <main>, and <aside> all have flex-shrink = 1, so all three flex items
            shrink at the same rate when the browser is resized.
        <nav> occupies 20% of the row, <main> occupies 60%, and <aside> 
            occupies 20%. 20% + 60% + 20% = 100% of the row.

                A patient, hardworking fourth-year student eager and willing to learn quickly and take initiative on 
                projects to assist in a position. I have had one summer research position working with the National Science 
                Foundations Research Experience for Undergraduates through New Mexico State Universitys BIG Data Analytics for 
                Cyber-physical Systems. I observed how fear is displayed in video games through agent interactions. 
                I created over 50 projects throughout my educational journey, ranging in industry fields such as game development, cryptography, data structures and algorithms, visual arts, and finance. 
                I consider myself a people-person. 
                I enjoy connecting with others through listening and dialogue. 
                I also appreciate the art of storytelling. Whether I am sharing my own or listening to others,
                    I value the mental and emotional experiences that occur when we share a part of ourselves. 
                    As Gonzagas Student Body Association as the Campus Inclusivity Coordinator, and I am over-zealous to apply my love of sharing with Gonzagaâ€™s community. 
                    I am working on projects centered around disability awareness, BIPOC and LGBTQ+ appreciation, and connecting Gonzaga with the city and county of Spokane.
